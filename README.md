## Description
CircuitMaker allows the user to make circuits that they can 'export' and use in different circuits. This should (eventually) allow the user to simulate an entire CPU (but not at the moment).

## Why?
This is a personal project, just to test the waters in Typescript. Expect to see a lot of wierd behaviours in the source code, this will eventually be fixed. Probably.

## What does this project use?
I wanted to minimize the external dependencies for the project, which is why this project only uses the following:
 - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
 - [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/)

And that's it, (for now) no other dependencies.

## Installing the project
To install this project you can do the following steps:
1. `git clone git@github.com:xandervedder/CircuitMaker.git`
2. `cd CircuitMaker/`
3. `npm i`

## Running the project
Starting the project is even easier: `npm start`

## Contributing
At the moment I don't have a 'good first issue' somewhere nor have I put this project on a site yet. It is on the TODO-list, though.
